I am interested in projects that are related to imaging, social impact, renewable energies, and social environment. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt 3B Digital, I have learned how to work in a team, use different project management tools, talk with clients and understand their needs, create projects on my own and be self-sufficient while helping my team with different tasks. I am mostly working on web development on my main work, but I like to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning on my own time, plus learning how algorithms work and solve different challenges in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).\n\n\n# Some history about me\n\n- My parents bought themselves a computer when I was 6. I don't remember much what computer was, but I loved playing Age of Empires. I spent many hours trying to understand how the game worked and how could a machine 'think' to beat me every time.\n\n- At 7, I learned what Internet was and started playing many games online in [Minijuegos](https://web.archive.org/web/20021203031928/https://www.minijuegos.com/). Loved that I could choose from a massive library of online games, and also my mom showed me how to download games from torrent, which was absolutely insane at that time!\n\n- I found fascinating anything related to computers. When I was 12 I had my first 'General Computer Knowledge' lesson in the school I was going to, where they explained to me what a processor, RAM, hard drive and other components were. Got for the first time the best grade in my class!\n\n- At 14, I discovered what [Parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhOmoMCIUTI) was and started learning about it and I would spend all the days in the summer training around 7-8 hours each day with my friends. It was really fun and loved jumping around. When I first heard the parkour philosophy I loved it.\n\n- At 15, my school counselor told me that I should think of starting to work and forget about studying a degree. Was a hard hit as I was just a kid who loved computer games and was not sure what he wanted to focus on yet.\n\n- At 16, I started the first course of many to learn about computers, system administration, programming, web development, scripting... Had loads of fun learning about networks, creating networks, repairing computers and had really nice teachers who encouraged me to keep studying because they trusted me and thought I had potential to be a good developer! I owe them a lot.\n\n- When I was 18 I tried to switch to learn photography and film making, but the teachers discouraged us and many people left the course halfway through as they did not find motivation to work on film making nor photography. I ended up leaving as well, but I learned many things that were very useful for my portrait photography and parkour film making skills.\n\n- At 19, I was still a bit confused and did an advanced course on network operating system administration, where I learned many new things and met new people who I am still close friends with. I was the second one with the best grades and I loved helping my classmates. I would spend hours with them explaining the things that we learned in class. My teachers and a couple of classmates motivated me to try to do a bachelor degree (In Spain the Computer Science degree is considered one of the hardest ones)\n\n- After finishing the network operating system administration course, I spent a few weeks relaxing and doing parkour. Finally, I set my mind to try to do that Bachelor degree. With a few old classmates we joined an academy as our math knowledge was very little, and we really needed a medium-high level of statistics, physics and algebra to have some chances of passing the degree subjects. We spent the whole summer trying to learn and figure it out.\n\n- When I was 21, I finally started the bachelor degree, it was hectic. I would spend around 10 hours studying + 6 hours of lessons each day trying to be able to pass the subjects. Ended up grading with honors in many subjects. I had a great group of classmates who helped me and I helped them. We started making great notes in class and then making them pretty and selling (cheap) them to other students. All the money we earned we spent it inviting our other classmates and ourselves for Christmas dinner.\n\n- My classmates (from the advanced course I did) and me, spent 3 years creating notes for other people, understanding complex concepts and solving many problems. Many of us thought of giving up as we had to dedicate more hours than the average student. We did not have a good math base, and we had to go to academies to learn statistics, algebra and physics.\n\n- At 24, I left to the Czech Republic to do one year of Erasmus. I learned a lot of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Algorithms and made many great friends who I still miss nowadays as everyone took very different paths.\n\n- After Erasmus, at 25, I finished my degree and ended up being in the top 10 people of my class with best grades which made me feel very accomplished and satisfied as I never thought I could reach this. Covid hit while I was in Erasmus, so I did not know what to do. I wanted to improve my English skills and I had some money left from some previous scholarships, so I decided to move to London and try to find a job here.\n\n- At 25, I got hired by 3B Digital where I made friends with my workmates and had a great time building web projects.\n\n- At 27 started to look for other opportunities where I could grow as a person and as a developer.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Gym\n- Parkour\n- Hiking\n- Exploring\n- Space and cosmos\n- Travel\n- Make new friends\n- Learn new things\n- Reading\n- Music\n- [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/nowrie_/)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from C\xf3rdoba, Spain. And I lived there most of my life except for the past 3 years.\n- I've been to many countries and I loved all of them, and I would like to revisit.\n- In 2005, I visited Syria as my father is from Damascus (The city of the sun).\n- In 2006, I visited London for the first time.\n- In 2017, I visited Portugal and I loved it.\n- In 2018, I visited France.\n- In 2019, I lived in the Czech Republic for a year and visited: Poland (many times), Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Denmark and Sweden. \n- In 2020, I mostly traveled inside the Czech Republic as the frontiers were closed. Met many people and discovered a lot about Czech culture.\n- In 2020, I also moved to London.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- learning more about self-development.\n- to be in control of my time.\n- to read as much as I can.\n- doing better.\n- to build my own house.\n- to travel around the world and visit most countries.\n- do something valuable for others.",l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,d.jsx)(o.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,d.jsx)(i.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Ismael Abujadur",children:(0,d.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,d.jsx)("header",{children:(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,d.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,d.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,d.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),(0,d.jsx)(r(),{source:h,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
